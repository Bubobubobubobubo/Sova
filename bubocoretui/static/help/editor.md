To edit scripts, you will have to use the text editor view. It will allow you write, edit and send the scripts that compose the current scene. There are two editing modes available either through the option menu or through keybindings:

## Modes

- `Normal mode` - EMACS based keybindings. Recommended for beginners.
- `Vim Mode` - (Neo-)Vim emulation of modal editing.

By default, the editor will start in `Normal mode`. 

## Common keybindings

* `Ctrl+S` - Send script to the server
* `Ctrl+E` - Enable/Disable the current `frame`
* `Ctrl` + `↑` / `↓` / `←` / `→` : Quick move between `frames`
