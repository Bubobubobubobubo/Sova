# MIDI

> MIDI (_Musical Instrument Digital Interface_) is the most widely used protocol for connecting musical instruments and computers. MIDI is ubiquitous, and will allow you to talk with most digital audio workstations, synthesizers, and other music software.

Sova has support for both MIDI input and output devices. You can connect multiple MIDI devices to Sova, and use them simultaneously. Up to 32 devices can be configured through the [DeviceMap](/docs/core/devices).
