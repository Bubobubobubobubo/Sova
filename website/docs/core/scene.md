# Scene

A scene is analogous to a "project" in other musical software. It is what you can save and later retrieve when you wish to work on a piece of music over several [sessions](docs/core/session.md). It is the collection of all scripts, all things that will unfold in time when you press play. A scene is formed by a list of [lines](docs/core/line.md). Each line is defined as a sequence of [frames](/docs/core/frame.md) that will be played one after the other. A scene can be thought of as a _song_, a _composition_, or boilerplate code for a _performance_.
