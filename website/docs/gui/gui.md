# GUI 

Sova provides a default graphical user interface (GUI) that allows to interact intuitively with the Sova ecosystem. It provides everything you need to create, edit, and perform your musical ideas collaboratively with other users. From the GUI, you can spawn and kill servers, create and/or join a session, edit and run scripts, live code until your fingers bleed, and much more. The GUI can be thought of as the main executable for newcomers to get started with Sova. It wraps up all the other components: the [Core](), the [Server](), the [Engine](), etc.
